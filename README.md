# Enveronment veriables in Golang

This example is inspired from [this](https://youtu.be/mnCgl-iwPak)

ENV veriables are key values pares. If you pass key, it will return value related to key.

We should not commit important or secreat information to Git. So to keep sensitive information to secreate level, we need to use env. 

Each process get its own seperate set of env variables. Veriable set in applicaiton are not impact other enveronment.
